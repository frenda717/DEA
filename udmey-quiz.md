### Data Engineering Fundamentals


1. A Data Engineer is tasked with creating a report on an Amazon RDS instance to support a customer loyalty analysis. The database contains two tables: Customers (listing all registered customers) and Orders (recording customer purchases). The report should retrieve all customers' information along with their order details if they have placed any orders. Which SQL query ensures that every customer is included, and orders are shown only if they exist?

        SELECT * FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Orders On Customers.CusteomerID = Orders.CustomerID

2. A Data Engineer discovers a critical bug in the production data transformation pipeline managed in a Git repository on the `master` branch. To comply with the company's policy of using feature branches for bug fixes and enhancements, which sequence of Git commands should the engineer use to set up their development environment to address this issue?

    a. git clone flollwed by git checkout -b
    b. git pull followed by git branch -b

    Answer: a. 
    the git clone command is used to make a local copy of the specified repository. Following this, the git checkout -b command creates a new branch and switches to it immediately. 
    This sequence is appropriate for starting work on a new branch, such as a hotfix branch
    (修補程序分支),directly after cloning a repository.

3. Data Engineer is using AWS Redshift to analyze sales data from a retail company. The table, `Monthly_Sales`, includes columns for `SaleID`, `ProductCategory`, `SaleMonth`, and `SaleAmount`. The task is to generate a monthly sales report, where each product category (Electronics, Clothing, Furniture) is **displayed as a column header** and each row represents a month with the total sales for that category. Which SQL operation should be used in AWS Redshift to efficiently generate the report according to the requirement?

    ![q4](./DEA/image/q4.png "Table")

    a. GROUP BY
    b. PIVOT

    Ansewr: b.

    題的關鍵在於「要把列變欄」，不是單純統計各分類金額，而是要顯示成報表格式 → 因此是 PIVOT。

4. A Data Engineer at a healthcare organization is tasked with analyzing patient satisfaction across various departments to identify areas for improvement. The patient population is diverse, with significant variations in age, treatment types, and outcomes. To ensure that the analysis is comprehensive and accounts for the diverse characteristics of the patient groups, the engineer must choose an appropriate method for sampling the data from the hospital's patient records database. What technique should the engineer use to accurately reflect the different segments of the patient population in the analysis?

    a. Random Sampling
    b. Stratified Sampling (分層)

    Answer: b.


5. A data engineering team is using Apache Spark to process a large dataset comprising user activity logs. The dataset is distributed across multiple nodes in a Spark cluster. During the processing, the team notices that **some tasks are taking significantly longer to complete than others**, causing delays in the overall processing time. Additionally, they observe that certain nodes in the cluster are consistently under heavier load compared to others.

    a. The data is configured with a low number of partitions
    b. There is a data skew in the input dataset

    Answer: b

    為什麼某些 Spark 任務耗時顯著更久，而某些節點的 負載特別重，導致整體處理延遲？

    a. The data is configured with a low number of partitions
    少量 partitions 會導致 整體並行度降低，也就是節點數多但工作不夠分，造成閒置。

    這通常會讓大多數任務差不多耗時，只是**整體速度慢**，不會造成**部分任務特別慢或負載特別不均**。

    👉 所以 不是造成「部分節點明顯較慢或忙」的主要原因。


    b. There is a data skew in the input dataset
    **資料傾斜（data skew）是指某些 key（或值）在資料中出現的頻率遠高於其他 key。**

    在 Spark 中，像 groupBy, join, reduceByKey 等操作會根據 key 分區，這樣會導致：

    熱點 key 被分到特定 partition

    那個 partition 會包含 大量資料與計算工作

    造成某些 task 明顯比其他 task 慢（而不是所有 task 一樣慢）

    **某些 worker 節點負載重，其餘節點相對輕鬆 → 資源使用不均**

    👉 這正是題目描述的現象。


6. A Data Engineer is tasked with developing a scalable data processing solution using AWS services to analyze game participation data. The solution needs to leverage data stored in three PostgreSQL tables within an Amazon RDS instance, as depicted in the provided ERD. The `games` table includes fields for `id`, `name`, and `time`, and the `players` table includes fields for `id`, and `name`, with table `games_players’ linking both the players and the games they participated in. Each player is allowed to participate once in a given game.

    ![q6](./DEA/image/q6.png "Table")
    
    Based on the ER diagram which constraint on `public.games_players` table is correct?

    CONSTRAINT fk_game FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES public.games(id)


7. A product owner at a retail company intends to disable an existing data pipeline that aggregates sales data across various departments. Before proceeding, the product owner wants to understand the impact this action will have on downstream processes and reports that rely on this data. To assist in this analysis, which approach should the data engineering team implement?
   
    a. Create a backup of the existing data sets.
    b. Implement data lineage throughout the pipeline.

8. A product owner at a financial analytics company is looking to **reduce storage costs** and **enhance the performance of SQL queries** on their large datasets of transaction records. The datasets are currently stored in a traditional row-oriented format, which has led to increased storage needs and slower query response times. To address these concerns, which file format should the data engineering team transition their data storage to?

    a. Migrate the data to a more efficient relational database (X)
    b. Archive older data to cold storage (X)
    c. **Convert the datasets to a columnar storage format** (O)

    Answer: c

    a: Incorrect because **relational database aren't designed to ideally serve horizontally scalable data warehousing solutions**.
    Besides that this solution doesn't address the inherent problems stated in the question such as reducing costs or increasing performance.

    b: Incorrect as this choice primarily focuses on reducing costs by moving less frequently accessed data to cheaper storage solutions. However,it does not enhance the performance of quieres on the data that remains active. Additionally, this action **does not improve the efficiency of data retrieval or procession for the active datasets**, which was a key goal of the product owner.

    c: Converting the data to a columnar storage format such as Prquet, aligns perfectly with the goals of reducing storage costs and boosting query performance. Columnar formats store data by columns rather than rows, making them ideal for analytics and complex queries as only the necessary columns need to read and processed. This leads to faster retrieval times and significant reductions in storage space, especially when dealing with large datasets.


9. An insurance company is planning to launch a new product that will utilize diverse data sources, including data from transactional systems, customer emails, and weblogs. To support analytics and machine learning models that will help tailor and optimize this product, which data storage solution should the data engineering team choose?

    Answer: Store all logs, emails, and transactional data in data lake.

10. A data engineer at a digital marketing firm is tasked with integrating various data sources for advanced analytics. The company collects data from social media interactions, website logs, and customer feedback surveys. Given the nature of data originating from multiple sources, which of the following describes the data correctly?

    Answer: Semi-structured data



### Storage
1. You are an AWS architect at CloudTech Innovations. One of your clients, MyPhotos Inc., runs a photo-sharing platform where users upload millions of photos daily. To optimize storage costs, the client has the following requirements:

    Photos that are uploaded should be immediately accessible for fast retrieval for 30 days.

    After 30 days, the photos should be transitioned to a storage class that's cost-effective but still ensures fairly quick access.

    After 365 days, the photos are seldom accessed and should be moved to the most cost-effective archival storage.

    If a photo hasn't been accessed for 5 years, it should be deleted to ensure GDPR compliance.

    Which S3 lifecycle policy should you configure to meet the client's requirements?

    a. Transition objects to S3 Standard-IA after 30 days, transition to S3 Glacier after 365 days, and delete after 5 years. (O)

    

    b. Transition objects to S3 ~~Intelligent-Tiering~~ after 30 days, transition to S3 ~~Glacier Deep Archive~~ after 365 days, and delete after 5 years. (X)

    **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** after 30 days：
    智慧分層是設計來自動根據存取頻率優化成本，適合「**存取模式不可預測**」的資料，但我們已明確知道這些照片前 30 天會常被存取，30–365 天「較少」存取，過後「幾乎不存取」。這種情境下不需 Intelligent-Tiering 的自動化功能，反而浪費錢（有監控費用）。

    Glacier Deep Archive 適用於極少存取且可接受長時間恢復（最高 12 小時）。
    在題目中說「365 天後偶爾仍可能存取」，但 Deep Archive 回復時間長，不符合「fairly quick access」 的需求。應該選 Glacier，而非 Deep Archive。

    c. Transition objects to S3 ~~Intelligent-Tiering~~ after 30 days, transition to S3 Glacier after 1 year, and enable Object Expiration for objects older than 5 years. (X)

2. A data engineering team uses Amazon S3 to store critical configuration files for their applications. These configurations are updated frequently, and sometimes they need to roll back to previous versions due to unforeseen issues. To ensure they can retrieve previous versions of a file, which of the following actions should they take regarding S3?

    Answer: Enable S3 Versioning for the bucket.

3. A data engineering team in Company XYZ is utilizing Amazon S3 to store transaction logs. These logs are essential for both operational reporting and compliance. They have a primary bucket in the us-east-1 region. To ensure that they have a backup of this data in another geographical location and to provide low-latency access to their Asia-based analysts, which of the following steps should they take?

    a. Enable S3 Cros Region Replication (CRR) on the primary bucket and replicate the logs to a bucket in the ap-southeast-1 region. (O)

    Company XYZ 想達成兩個目標：
    ✅ 在不同地理區域建立備份（backup） — 為了資料備援與合規性。

    ✅ 讓亞洲分析人員能低延遲存取資料 — 提供接近分析使用者的資料存取點（低延遲）。

    S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
    功能：CRR 可以自動地、非同步地將 S3 bucket 的資料從一個 AWS 區域（如 us-east-1）複製到另一個區域（如 ap-southeast-1）。

    優點：
    滿足 資料備援與災難復原需求（備份在不同區域）。
    亞洲分析師可以直接在 ap-southeast-1 區域的 bucket 上存取資料，實現低延遲。
    條件：來源 bucket 必須開啟版本控制（versioning），並設定目標 bucket 也在目標區域。

    📌 完全符合兩個需求 → 正確答案

    b. Set up Transfer Acceleration on the primary bucket and direct the Asia-based analysts to this accelerated endpoint.

    S3 Transfer Acceleration
    功能：透過 Amazon CloudFront 邊緣節點加速跨地區上傳/下載 S3 資料。

    優點：
    加快從全球任一地點對「單一 bucket」的資料傳輸速度。

    缺點：
    無法實現跨區域備援，因為資料仍只存在 us-east-1。
    雖然對亞洲分析師的資料下載會變快，但 並未真正將資料複製到亞洲區域，仍然是從美國讀取。

    📌 僅解決存取延遲，但不解決備份問題 → 不是最佳選擇

4. A data engineering team in Company ABC wants to create a data pipeline where new files uploaded to an S3 bucket trigger a Lambda function for processing. The processed data is then stored in a different S3 bucket. The goal is to simplify the creation and maintenance of this pipeline. Which of the following configurations will meet the team's requirements?

    a. Set up and S3 even notification on the source bucket to trigger the Lambda function when a new object is created. (O)
    This is the correct answer. S3 event notifications can be set up to notify and trigger other AWS services, like Lambda,
    upon specific events in the bucket, such as the creation of a new object.

    b. Use AWS Data Pipeline with a data node representing the source bucket and periodically poll for new files to trigger the Lambda function.

    AWS Data Pipeline can automate the movement and transformation of data. While it can poll an S3 bucket for new files, using it in this scenario introduces more complexity than necessary. 

5. Company DEF has a strict security policy that mandates that all data at rest in Amazon S3 must be encrypted. They want to ensure that the encryption keys are managed by AWS, but they also want the flexibility to change the encryption keys when required. Which of the following encryption methods best meets Company DEF's requirements?

    Answer: Server-Side Encryption with AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)

    With AWS SSE-KMS, AWS key Management Service manages the encryption kes, but customer retain the ability to manage and change their own encryption keys using KMS.

6. An e-commerce company has large amounts of transaction data stored on-premises through an NFS file share. They want to leverage AWS Lambda to analyze this data while continuing to use the NFS system for data storage, ensuring that Lambda can concurrently access this data. Which of the following solutions will best meet the company's requirements?

    Answer: Use Amazon EFS to create a file system and synchronize data from the on-premises NFS. Then, configure the AWS Lambda funtion to access the EFS file system.

    Amazon EFS supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol, which allows for seamless integration with existing applications and workflows that reply on NFS. AWS Lambda can directly integrate withe Amazon EFS, providing concurrent access to the shared data

7. A company is designing a data lake on Amazon S3. To ensure high performance when accessing the data, which best practice should the company adopt in organizing its data in the S3 bucket?

    a. Use a flat structure by avoiding the creation of any prefix or "folder" hierarchy. (X)
    Using a flat structure without any prefix or "folder" hierarchy can lead to inefficiencies when trying to  access or manage the data. Organizing data with logical prefixes can help in improving the data access pattern.

    b. Partition data based on commonly accessed attributes and use a consistent naming schema for prefiex. (O)
    Partitioning data based on frequently accessed attributes (eg. date, region or prooduct type) and using a consistent naming scheme for prefixes allows efficient data retrieval and can redue the cost of queries.

    For example, for time-based queries, partitioning data by year, month, or day can make data retrieval much faster.

8. A company is using an Amazon S3 bucket to store sensitive data for its data engineering pipeline. The company's security team has mandated that all access to this data should originate only from within the company's VPC. Which action should the data engineering team take to ensure this security requirement is met?

    a. Enable VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3 and associate them with the company's VPC (X)
    Enabling VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3 for private connections between the VPC and S3 without travering the public internet. However, **merely enabling VPC Endpoints does not prevent access from outside the VPC by default**.

    Enable VPC Endpoints for Amazon S3
    ✅ 優點：
    VPC Endpoint（Gateway Endpoint for S3）可以讓 VPC 中的資源（如 EC2）私下連到 S3，不走公網。

    ❌ 但問題是：
    它只是開通一條私有通道，但不會阻擋其他來源（如公網 IP、其他帳號、其他 VPC）來存取該 bucket。

    如果沒有額外設定 bucket policy，其他來源依然可以透過 S3 public endpoint 存取該 bucket（如果有權限）。

    📌 僅解決私有連線，但無法阻擋非 VPC 存取 → 不符合題目要求。


    b. Update the S3 bucket policy to deny all requests that do not originate from the company's VPC. (O)
    By updating the S3 bucket policy to explicity deny requests that don't come from the company's VPC (using the aws:SourceVpce condition key), the data engineering team can enforce that access originates only from within the specified VPC.

    c. Use AWS KMS to encrypt the S3 bucket, ensuring only the company's VPC has the decryption key. (X)
    ✅ AWS KMS 加密資料可以控管「誰」可以解密資料。

    ❌ 但：
    KMS policies 無法限制「只能從特定 VPC 存取」解密。

    資料還是可以被下載（甚至從公網），只是可能無法解密而已。

    此方法無法阻擋存取路徑或來源，只是加密的補強。

    📌 KMS 是資料保護手段，不是網路存取控制手段 → 不符合題目要求。

9. In a data engineering pipeline, a company is using multiple applications and teams to access a shared Amazon S3 bucket. To streamline access and simplify permissions management for these different entities, which S3 feature should the company utilize?

    a. Enable multiple IAM roles, each corresponding to an application or team, granting access to the S3 bucket.
    IAM 的優點：
    IAM roles 可用來精細控制誰可以對資源進行什麼操作

    ❌ 缺點：
    當有多個團隊、應用都需存取同一個 S3 bucket，IAM policy 管理會變得複雜且難維護

    你必須在 IAM 中加入所有 bucket ARN 和具體操作，容易出錯、缺乏靈活性

    不提供獨立的端點，每個存取者都需知道完整 bucket 路徑與權限細節

    📌 適用於小規模或角色明確情境，不適合共享大型 S3 資料集 → 不是最佳解法

    b. Use S3 Access Points to create unique endpoints whith tailored permissions for each application or team. (O)
    Access Points offer simplified method to manage data access at scale for applications using shared data sets on S3.
    
    **Access Points 專為「共享 bucket，分組授權」的情境設計**
    每個 Access Point：
    有自己獨立的 endpoint
    有自己的 IAM policy
    可限定對 bucket 中特定 prefix 的存取

    ✅ 優點：
    簡化權限管理與資源隔離（每組/應用一個 Access Point）
    支援高可用與安全控管（配合 VPC、限制 IP、限制操作等）
    可搭配 VPC Access Points 實現私有網路專用存取

    📌 正是題目需求的官方推薦方案

10. A data engineering pipeline leverages multiple AWS resources, including Amazon RDS, Amazon EFS, and Amazon DynamoDB. The company wants a centralized backup solution that offers consistent backup and restore capabilities across these services. Which AWS service should the company use to meet this requirement?

    Answer: Use AWS Backup to centrally manage backups across the metioned AWS resources.

11. 



### Database
1. (See DynamoDB – Partitions Internal) 
    To compute the number of partitions:
    • # 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦= 
    \(\left( \frac{RCUS_{Total}}{3000} \right) + \left( \frac{WCUS_{Total}}{1000} \right)\)

    • # 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑏𝑦 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒=𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒
    \(\frac {𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑖𝑧𝑒}{10 GB}\)

    • # 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠=
    ceil(max# 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑏𝑦 𝑐𝑎𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦,# 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑏𝑦 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 )



### Migration and Transfer

1. You are a solutions architect designing a migration plan for a company's on-premises data center to AWS. The company's CIO wants to understand their current environment, including server utilization and dependencies, before starting the migration. Which of the following statements about the AWS Application Discovery Service (ADS) is accurate?

    a.  When using the AWS Application Discovery Service Agentless Discovery mode, there is no need to install any software on the on-premises servers. (O)

    The Agentles Discovery mode uses a VMware-based environment to gather information about the on-premisees servers without the need to install any agents.

    Agentless Discovery 模式 是 ADS 的一種掃描方式，專門為 VMware 環境設計。
    它會部署在一台 VMware vCenter 的管理端（透過 vCenter API 擷取資料），所以：
    ❌ 不需要在每台 on-premise 伺服器上安裝 agent。
    ✅ 可以自動收集如：CPU、RAM 使用率、磁碟、網路活動、依賴關係等。


    b. AWS Application Discovery Service is ~~not integrated~~ with AWS Schema Conversion Tool, so you need a separate tool for database migration planning

    錯在「not integrated」這句話：事實上，AWS Application Discovery Service（ADS） 是與 AWS Schema Conversion Tool（SCT）整合的，可以一起用來協助你分析和規劃資料庫與應用程式的遷移。

    SCT 可以匯入從 ADS 掃描出的結果，進一步做資料庫依賴分析與轉換建議。

    c. AWS Application Discovery Service ~~requires an internet connection~~ for its agents to discover on-premises applications
   
    Discovery Agent 是在本地執行偵測作業（不需連網就能分析本地資料），它會把偵測資料先儲存在本地檔案中，然後再批次傳送至 AWS（需網路才能傳送結果，但不是發現所必需）。

    此外，對於安全性高的環境，還可以選擇只將 匿名化資料 上傳到 AWS，或透過 Proxy 或私有連線（如 Direct Connect）傳送資料。


    Answer: a.

2. You are working on a migration project, and your organization has chosen to leverage AWS Application Migration Service (MGN) for moving applications to AWS. Which of the following statements accurately describes a key feature or characteristic of the AWS Application Migration Service?

    a. AWS Application Migration Service can automatically replicate live server volumes to AWS, allowing for minimal cutover windows. (O)

    AWS AMS replicates live server volumes to AWS, which can be used to launch cloud instances mirroring your on-premise environments. This allows for a minimal cutover window, minimizing downtime.

    AWS Application Migration Service（MGN） 是 AWS 的主推遷移工具，用來把 **實體或虛擬伺服器**完整搬到 AWS。

    ✅ 這種「幾乎即時」同步的機制，可以讓你做到最小化停機時間（cutover window）。

    📌 官網說明：「Continuous block-level replication ensures that data is kept up to date with minimal lag.」


    b. AMS requires agents to be installed on each on-premises ~~database~~.

    錯在「database」這個詞：

    (1) MGN 並不是針對「資料庫遷移」設計的，而是**針對整個伺服器/應用程式**（含 OS、應用與資料）做完整複製。

    若要**遷移資料庫，你會用 AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)**，而不是 MGN。

    (2) MGN 安裝的是 replication agent，不是 database agent：

    **MGN 是在整台伺服器（包括應用、作業系統、資料）層級安裝 agent**。

    它不需要你去「單獨處理資料庫層的 agent 安裝」或設定。

    而且 不是所有伺服器都必須是 database 才能用。


3. You have been tasked with migrating an on-premises MySQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS). The stakeholder emphasizes that the source database must remain fully operational during the migration process. Which of the following statements about DMS is accurate with respect to this scenario?

    a. AWS DMS supports both full-load and continuous replication, allowing the source MySQL database to remain operational during migration (O)

    AWS DMS allows for both full-load migration and continuous replication using change data capture (CDC). This ensures that the source database opereational, and changes to the source databasse can be continously replicated to the target during the migration.

    AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) 的設計目標就是不中斷來源資料庫運作的遷移。

    它使用兩階段的遷移流程：

    Full Load（全量載入）：將現有資料一次性地載入到目標資料庫（這期間來源資料仍可正常運作）

    Change Data Capture（CDC）：持續地將來源資料庫中之後的變更（新增、修改、刪除）同步到目標

    ✅ 這樣可以確保 「源資料庫不中斷服務」的需求被滿足，直到最終 cutover（轉換使用目標 DB）前。

    📌 這種方式很適合：

    停機成本高的系統

    需要雙寫、同步測試的遷移情境


    b. AWS DMS can convert the MySQL database schema directly to PostgreSQL without any manual intervention.

    **AWS DMS 本身 主要是做 資料內容（data）遷移，不負責資料庫 schema 的轉換**。

    例如：資料表、資料型別、索引、觸發器、儲存程序等結構

    **跨資料庫引擎的遷移**（例如 MySQL → PostgreSQL） 時，**必須使用另一個工具**：

    ➤ **AWS Schema Conversion Tool（SCT)**

    SCT 可以分析來源與目標之間的差異

    自動轉換大部分 schema，但有些部分仍可能需要人工修改

    SCT 可生成 conversion report，指出哪些部分需要手動處理


4. You are a data engineer responsible for transferring large datasets from an on-premises data center to an Amazon S3 bucket daily. You've chosen AWS DataSync for this task due to its ability to accelerate data transfer. Which of the following statements correctly describes a feature or consideration when using AWS DataSync for this use case?

    a. AWS DataSync can be used to transfer data directly from on-premises databases to Amazon S3 without any intermediate storage. (X)

    **AWS DataSync is desgined to transfer files or objects, not directly from databases**. To migrate data from databases, tools like AWS Data Migration Service would be more appropriate.

    b. When usging AWS DataSync, data transferred over the internet is encrpted using SSL/TLS. (O)
    
    AWS DataSync encrpts data at rest an in transit. When transferring data over the internet, it uses SSL/TLS to ensure the data's confidentiality and integrity.

    c. AWS DataSync ~~does not support sheculed data transferes~~ and requires manual initiation for each transfer operation. (X)
    
    AWS DataSync 支援排程（scheduling）：
    你可以在建立或編輯任務時設定每日、每小時、每週等自動排程。
    透過 AWS Management Console、CLI、或 API 都可以設定。


    d. AWS DataSync ~~requires manual configuration each time~~ data needs to be transferred to ensure data integrity. (X)

    AWS DataSync 是設計成自動化、可靠且高效的資料傳輸工具。

    資料完整性檢查是自動進行的：

    DataSync 會在傳輸時自動做 檔案校驗（checksum），確保傳輸後的檔案正確無誤。

    不需要你每次手動配置或加額外檢查。

5. You are working on a project to migrate an on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. During the assessment phase, you recognize there are numerous stored procedures, triggers, and functions that need conversion to be compatible with Aurora PostgreSQL. Which AWS service will assist you most directly in converting the schema and database code for this migration?

    AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)

6. A media company wants to migrate their legacy video archive, consisting of several petabytes of data, from their on-premises data center to Amazon S3. **Due to limited network bandwidth** and the need to **ensure a secure and efficient data transfer process**, which AWS service would be the most appropriate to facilitate this large-scale data migration?

    a. AWS Transfer Family (X)
    
    **AWS Transfere Family** foucuses on transferring files over protocols like SFTP,FTPS and FTP. While it's a good solution for many file transfer scenarios, **it's not tailored fo migrating several petabytes of data with bandwidth constraints**.

    b. AWS Snow Family (O)
    
    AWS Snow Family, including Snowcone, Snowball, and Snomobile, is **desgined for offline data transfer, especially for large datasets**. Given the volumn(several petabytes) and contraints(limited bandwidth), Snow Family would be the most appropriate solution.


7. A financial services company is modernizing its IT infrastructure. They currently rely on an on-premises server for securely transferring financial transaction files between their internal systems and external partners using the SFTP protocol. They wish to migrate this file transfer workload to AWS without changing the SFTP-based integration points or the user experience of their partners. Which AWS service would best address this requirement?

    a. AWS Snowball (X)
    b. AWS Transfer Family (O)

    AWS Transfer Family is designed for **secure file transfers to AWS** using familiar protocols such as SFTP, FTPS and FTP. It provides a seamless migration experience without the need to modify the existing SFTP-based workflows or integrations.
